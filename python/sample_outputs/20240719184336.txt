PROMPT:write a shell script that returns the AWS account I am running and my ARN 

****** codestral:latest******
 Below is an example of a bash script that will return the AWS Account ID and the ARN of the current user who is running the script. This script uses AWS CLI commands.

Make sure to replace `<your_region>` with your AWS region.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get AWS Account ID
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)

# Get ARN of current user
ARN=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Arn" --output text)

echo "AWS Account ID: $ACCOUNT_ID"
echo "ARN: $ARN"
```

You can save this script to a file, for example, `account_info.sh`, then make it executable with the command `chmod +x account_info.sh`. Run the script using `./account_info.sh`. This will print out your AWS Account ID and ARN.

 To create a shell script that retrieves information about the current AWS account you are running, including the Account ID and ARN, you can use the AWS CLI. The following is a simple shell script using Bash to accomplish this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to get the AWS Account ID
get_account_id() {
    echo "Fetching AWS Account ID..."
    ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text)
    if [ -z "$ACCOUNT_ID" ]; then
        echo "Failed to retrieve the AWS Account ID." >&2
        exit 1
    else
        echo "AWS Account ID: $ACCOUNT_ID"
    fi
}

# Function to get the ARN
get_arn() {
    echo "Fetching ARN..."
    ARN=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Arn' --output text)
    if [ -z "$ARN" ]; then
        echo "Failed to retrieve the ARN." >&2
        exit 1
    else
        echo "ARN: $ARN"
    fi
}

# Main script execution
echo "Running script for AWS Account and ARN information..."
get_account_id
get_arn
```

### Explanation:
1. **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: This line tells the system to use Bash as the interpreter for this script.
2. **Functions `get_account_id` and `get_arn`**: These functions use the AWS CLI command `aws sts get-caller-identity` to fetch the Account ID and ARN, respectively. The `--query` option is used to specify which part of the JSON response to extract, and `--output text` ensures that the output is plain text.
3. **Error Handling**: If either command fails (e.g., due to an AWS CLI configuration issue or network problem), the script will print an error message and exit with a status code indicating failure.
4. **Main Script Execution**: The script starts by printing a header, then calls both functions to fetch and display the Account ID and ARN.

### Usage:
1. Save this script to a file, for example, `get_aws_info.sh`.
2. Make the script executable with the command: `chmod +x get_aws_info.sh`.
3. Run the script using: `./get_aws_info.sh`.

This script assumes that you have already configured the AWS CLI and have appropriate permissions to execute identity-related commands. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your AWS CLI is properly configured and consider checking the output of the script for detailed error messages.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get AWS account ID
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text)

# Get ARN
arn=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Arn' --output text)

# Print the results
echo "AWS Account ID: $account_id"
echo "ARN: $arn"
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`#!/bin/bash`**: This line specifies that the script should be executed using the bash shell.
2. **`account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text)`**: 
   - `aws sts get-caller-identity`: This command uses the AWS CLI to retrieve the caller identity information.
   - `--query 'Account'`:  This option specifies that we want to extract the "Account" field from the response.
   - `--output text`: This option ensures the output is in plain text format.
   - The `$(...)` part executes the command and stores its output in the `account_id` variable.

3. **`arn=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Arn' --output text)`**: 
   - Similar to the previous line, this retrieves the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) from the caller identity information.

4. **`echo "AWS Account ID: $account_id"`**: Prints the retrieved account ID with a descriptive label.
5. **`echo "ARN: $arn"`**: Prints the retrieved ARN with a descriptive label.


**How to use:**

1. **Save the script:** Create a new file (e.g., `get_aws_info.sh`) and paste the code into it.
2. **Make it executable:**  `chmod +x get_aws_info.sh` 
3. **Run the script:** `./get_aws_info.sh`

**Important:**

- This script requires that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured on your system.
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to use the `sts:GetCallerIdentity` API action.

Here is a sample shell script that uses `aws sts get-caller-identity` to retrieve your AWS account ID and IAM user ARN:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current AWS account ID and IAM user ARN using STS
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' --output text)
arn=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Arn' --output text)

echo "AWS Account ID: ${account_id}"
echo "IAM User ARN: ${arn}"
```
Let me explain what this script does:

1. `aws sts get-caller-identity`: This AWS CLI command returns information about the caller, including the account ID and IAM user ARN.
2. `--query 'Account'` and `--query 'Arn'`: These options specify which fields in the response we want to extract. In this case, we're interested in the `Account` field (which contains the AWS account ID) and the `Arn` field (which contains the IAM user ARN).
3. `--output text`: This option tells AWS CLI to output the extracted values as plain text, rather than JSON.
4. The script uses command substitution (`$( )`) to execute the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command and capture its output.
5. Finally, the script prints out the retrieved account ID and ARN using `echo`.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `get_account_arn.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x get_account_arn.sh`, and then run it with `./get_account_arn.sh`. This should print out your AWS account ID and IAM user ARN.
