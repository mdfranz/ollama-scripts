PROMPT:Given me the aws cli command to tell me if I'm running an IAM user

****** codestral:latest******
 AWS CLI does not have a specific command that can be used to check whether you are currently using an IAM user for your session. However, you could use the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command which returns details about the identity whose credentials are being used to call the AWS CLI including the AWS account ID, the IAM user name, and the ARN of the temporary security credentials (if using temporary security credentials).

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This command will return a JSON object that includes your AWS account ID, user ID, and ARN. If the user ID is not "root" or similar (indicating the root user), then you are running as an IAM user.

 To determine whether you are currently using an AWS CLI command to identify whether you are running under an IAM user context, you can use the following AWS CLI command:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This command retrieves information about the AWS account that is making the request by returning a variety of details including the `UserId`, which typically includes the string "IAMUser". Here's what you should see if your session is running under an IAM user context:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAJQABLZ3GEXAMPLE",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/your-username"
}
```

If you are running under an IAM role context (for example, if you're using a temporary security credentials provided by AWS STS), the `UserId` might look different but will still include "IAM" or refer to the specific role.

You can't directly check with a single AWS CLI command if you are currently running as an IAM user. 

Here's why and what you can do instead:

**Understanding the Limitations**

* **Security:** The AWS CLI doesn't expose your current IAM identity information for security reasons. If it did, attackers could potentially exploit this to learn about your permissions.
* **Environment-Dependent:**  Your execution context (e.g., a terminal session or an EC2 instance) determines which IAM credentials are used by the AWS CLI. This can change dynamically.

**Workarounds**

1. **Get Credentials Information:** Use `aws sts get-caller-identity` to retrieve information about the AWS account ID and ARN of the entity (user, role, etc.) making the request:

   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

   This will output JSON containing details like:
   * `Account`: Your AWS account ID.
   * `Arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user or role you are currently running as.

2. **Examine IAM Roles:** If you're working within an EC2 instance or container, check for any attached IAM roles. These roles define your permissions:

   ```bash
   # On Linux instances
   aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id <your_instance_id> --attribute-name InstanceRoleArn 
   # Replace '<your_instance_id>' with the actual ID of your instance

   # For Docker containers (assuming you've configured AWS credentials correctly):
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```


**Important Notes:**

* **Security Best Practices:** Avoid storing your AWS access keys directly in scripts or configuration files. Use IAM roles for secure and temporary access to AWS resources.
* **Context Matters:** Remember that the user or role you are currently running as might change based on factors like environment, execution context, and how credentials are configured.

You can use the following AWS CLI command to check if you are currently authenticated as an IAM user:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
This command will return information about the entity that is making the request, including:

* `UserId`: The unique identifier of the IAM user or role.
* `Account`: The AWS account ID associated with the IAM user or role.
* `Arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.

If you are authenticated as an IAM user, this command will return information about that user. If you are not authenticated as an IAM user, this command will return an error message.

For example:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
{
  "UserId": "AIDAIAIEXAMPLE",
  "Account": "123456789012",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AIWUexampleuser"
}
```
Note that this command only works if you have an AWS CLI configuration file (`.aws/credentials` or `.aws/config`) set up on your machine, and if you are currently authenticated to AWS using those credentials. If you don't have an AWS CLI configuration file set up, you'll need to run the `aws configure` command first to set up your AWS credentials.
